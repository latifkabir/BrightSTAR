- Run 15 FMS runlist is based on QAed runlist from Chong / Akio (see under resources directory)

- Run 17 FMS runlist can be based on the one made by Chris and can be found here: https://www.star.bnl.gov/protected/spin/dilks/trgmon17/500/trigger.html
  Based on the above good runlist reference, the FMS trigger was elevated to physics from day 74 (this is only for FMS stream). All runs prior to day 74 have been excluded in the FMS runlist json file.
