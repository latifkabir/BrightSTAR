To Be Done
-----------

- Emc photon reconstruction: Tpc track veto. Use center of tower for the comparison. Decide if size of twoer is enouugh or 2 x size of the tower to be used.
- Charged particle pid: for TPC dEdx, use veto on nsig of proton while identifyting pion and so on. See Zinlong's slide.
- Sometimes `condor_q -global` fails to retrieve status. Depending on it to count no. of jobs might be fail. grep output to count `Failed` first.
- Move event info from EEMC part1 and merge to part3 and delete part1 completely which takes large disk space/
